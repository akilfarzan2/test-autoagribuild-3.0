I will be storing information here

So right now, in this build so far, we need to make the following
- replace the headers and stuff for other pages, because there's 2 headers at the moment
- download PDF (revert back and maybe try again to see if it downloads the PDFs properly)
- Log in screen + changing password in settings
- fix up the signautre pad so you can see the actual signatures
- Create the Auto Total A calculator and make sure to put a table for them to change up the values for the Services and stuff, for the autocalculation
- setting: log inscreen password change, master password and a variable password), and tramsition screen on and off

- integration to XERO and Invoice button later
